## C is a very popular language used for various things ranging from application development to game development

[A quick tutorial for C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)

# Features of C++
1. ## Object Oriented
	C++ is an Object Oriented Programming(OOP) language unlike its predecessor C. In OOP everything is treated as an object which can be created or destroyed. Using OOP also has other advantages like being able to use the concepts of: 
	- Classes
	- Objects
	- Encapsulation
	- Polymorphism
	- Inheritance
	- Abstraction
 2. ## Machine Independent
	C++ is not [platform independent](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/writing-os-independent-code-cc/) but it is machine independent which means you can code with C++ on different OS but you cannot run the executable file genereated in one OS on another OS
3. ## High-Level Language
	C++ is a high level language which means it is easier for us humans to understand it as it is closely associated with the human-comprehensible English language
4. ## Dynamic Memory Allocation
	Many times, We are not aware in advance how much memory is needed to store particular information in a defined variable and the size of required memory can be determined at run time. So When the program executes in C++ then the variables are allocated the [dynamical heap space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/).
5. ## Memory Management
	-   C++ allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run time. This is known as [Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-language-2-gq/dynamic-memory-allocation-gq/).
	-   In other programming languages such as Java the compiler automatically manages the memories allocated to variables. But this is not the case in C++.
	-   In C++, the memory must be de-allocated dynamically allocated memory manually after it is of no use.
	-   The allocation and deallocation of the memory can be done using the [new and delete operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-and-delete-operators-in-cpp-for-dynamic-memory/) respectively.
6. ##  Simple
	It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has rich library support and has a variety of data types. Also, the Auto Keyword of C++ makes life easier.
